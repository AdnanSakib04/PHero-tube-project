                        <span class="text-[#FF1F3D]">var:</span> Now I am going to explain the scope of var which is
                        functional scope. First of all, by scope in easy words we mean the range of view or
                        effectiveness. Let’s say I created a function named todaysWeather. Inside the function
                        todaysWeather, I created a for loop and inside the loop I declared a variable
                        todaysWeatherInCelsius using the var keyword. Though the variable is declared inside the for
                        loop of the function, I can still access the variable todaysWeatherInCelsius, anywhere in the
                        function. This is because of hoisting. When we declare any variable inside a function using var
                        keyword it takes the variable declaration at the beginning of the function. This is the reason
                        why I was able to access the variable todaysWeatherInCelsius across the function. Which tells us
                        that the scope of var is function level.
                        Var can also be redeclared; for instance, I might use the var keyword anywhere inside the same
                        function to declare another variable called todaysWeatherInCelsius.

                        We can redeclare a variable using var and update its value. <br> <br>
                        <span class="text-[#FF1F3D]">let:</span> The scope of let is block level. Let me first explain
                        what is block level. In easy words, we can say that anything within the curly brackers {} are
                        known as block level statements and the curly brackets indicates block. Let’s say I created a
                        function named todaysWeather. Inside the function todaysWeather, I created a for loop and inside
                        the loop I declared a variable todaysWeatherInCelsius using the let keyword. Now I can only
                        access the variable todaysWeatherInCelsius, inside the for loop, where it was declared. But a
                        variable which is declared using let keyword cannot be redeclared but we can update the value.
                        For example let’s say I created an if block and declared a variable named todaysTemperature
                        using let, inside the if block and assigned the value 20 to it. I cannot redeclare the variable
                        again in that if block, but I can update its value, for example I can update its value to 30.
                        <br> <br>


                        <span class="text-[#FF1F3D]">const:</span> As mentioned above, the scope of let is same as the
                        scope of const. So the scope of const is block level. Let’s consider there is a function named
                        todaysWeather. Inside the function todaysWeather, there is a for loop and inside the loop a
                        variable is declared as todaysWeatherInCelsius using the const keyword with the value 10. Now I
                        can only access the variable todaysWeatherInCelsius, inside the for loop, where it was declared.
                        But a variable which is declared using const keyword cannot be redeclared and also we cannot
                        update the value. For example let’s say there is an if block and inside it there is a variable
                        named todaysTemperature declared using const, assigned the value 15 to it. We cannot redeclare
                        the variable again in that if block, and also cannot update its value.

                <div class="mb-20">
                    <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-3 text-center">Tell us the use cases of <span
                            class="text-[#FF1F3D]">null</span> and <span class="text-[#FF1F3D]">undefined</span></h1>
                    <div class="p-6 text-xs md:text-xl   font-bold text-justify rounded-3xl shadow-2xl ">We will use
                        null when we
                        want to address empty values. For example, if I want to declare a variable named
                        todaysWeatherInCelsius and want to set its value later or I want to use this variable later, I
                        will use null. If I don’t set todaysWeatherInCelsius to null and don’t assign any values and if
                        I then print the variable, it will give me undefined. So, to avoid undefined I will set the
                        variable todaysWeatherInCelsius to null.
                        <br> <br>
                        There are some other reasons why we can get undefined.

                                For example, I want to create an object named myNewWatch that has two properties:
                                strapColorOfMyWatch and strapMaterialOfMyWatch. Now if I want to access the property
                                called
                                weightOfMyWatch of the myNewWatch object, it will give me undefined because the property
                                weightOfMyWatch does not exist for the object myNewWatch.

                                Let me give another example, suppose I am coding in JavaScript and I have created a
                                function
                                and inside the function I print yesterday's temperature in Celsius. This will also give
                                me
                                undefined because there is no return statement or I am not returning anything inside the
                                function. So the function will give me undefined by default as it is the nature of
                                JavaScript.

                                I will give another example. Let's say I created an array as: const myOldWatch =
                                ['myOldWatchStrapColorIsBlue', 'myOldWatchStrapMaterialIsSteel']. Now if I want to
                                access
                                the array myOldWatch by myOldWatch[5], it will give me undefined because the array has
                                only
                                two indexes: 0 and 1.

                    <div class="p-6 text-xs md:text-xl   font-bold text-justify rounded-3xl shadow-2xl ">An API is a
                        collection of
                        instruction that acts as a bridge between two programs. An API that adheres to the
                        representational state transfer, design principles is known as a REST API. Let’s understand API
                        by a pharmacy store example. Whenever you visit a pharmacy, the salesman or the owner helps you.
                        You tell him what medicines you want. The owner or salesman then goes to the medicine cabinet,
                        and brings it to you. The owner is the middleman in this situation. The owner/salesman receives
                        a request (the medicine customer wants) from the customer, takes the request to the medicine
                        cabinet (server), and fetches the medicines (response). We know that there are some common
                        database operations like creating, reading, updating, and removing records within a resource,
                        REST APIs interact via HTTP requests to perform these operations. It includes few methods such
                        as, POST to generate data, DELETE method to delete data, PUT to update and GET to receive data
                        from a REST API.</div>
